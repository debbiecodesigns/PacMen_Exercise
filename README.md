Project Title: PacMen Exercise
Description of Project: This exercise will help students familiarize themselves on how to control the Document Object Model. A function that loops through the array of pacmen on click makes the images seem to move across the screen.
How to Run: Open the index.html file on a browser and click on the Pacman image to activate the motion.
Future Improvements: Add a background color/image to the project.
